title: Welcome to my new blog

It's been five years since I wrote something with more than 140 characters. Looking back on things I actually missed it. There was a time where everything was too much and I didn't want to write anything. That time has passed.

What will I write here? Mostly my thoughts and probably more tutorials for different devices that I own. In the upcoming weeks expect:

- Importance of backups
- Xpenology guide: How to setup it on DSM 6.1.7
- Asus Router with Merlin Firmware and blocking ads for all devices

I hope you'll find them useful and talk to you later!
