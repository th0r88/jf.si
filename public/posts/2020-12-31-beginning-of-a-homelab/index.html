  <h1> Beginning of a homelab </h1>

  
    <div id=sub-header>
      December 2020 · 6 minute read
    </div>
  

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>It all started when my friend E. introduced me to the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/">Homelab</a>. Coincidentally this was on the 1st of April when we&rsquo;re quite hopeful that the whole 2020 situation will go away soon. I started reading all the subreddit&rsquo;s posts and was hooked.</p>
<p>The main reason to build a homelab was to replace my weak Synology 216play and to extend my storage, my computing power, and learn more about hypervisors, container systems, etc. Did I achieve that? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>
<p>People who know me know that I have a history with hardware and assembling and disassembling computers. I do not have so much experience with enterprise-grade hardware and this was a great opportunity. Especially because I love setting up hardware and later software on all kinds of computers.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-the-basement">Preparing the basement</h2>
<p>House, where I live, had a spare room in the basement that needed some fixing up. Well, it needed a bit more fixing up that I&rsquo;m leading on especially because beforehand it was known as <em>the rat room</em>. Yeah, that&rsquo;s right rats chew through the floor and took this room for their home.</p>
<p><img src="https://jf.si/images/2020/12/IMG_0237.jpg" alt="The Rat Room - Before"></p>
<p>Because I started doing this during lockdown material was hard to get to but I somehow managed and start working. First I painted all the walls and fixed the humidity damage on them. Then I started working on the floor. I put some floor foam on it and then over it vinyl. It came out pretty good for an amateur.</p>
<p><img src="https://jf.si/images/2020/12/IMG_0248.jpg" alt="After"></p>
<h2 id="installing-ethernet-cables">Installing ethernet cables</h2>
<p>For my ethernet cables, I chose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_6_cable">CAT6</a> that in my opinion are the best for my case in performance vs. price. I bought the cable in a box packaged as 305 m. Before I bought the cable box I&rsquo;ve made a network diagram to calculate how much cable did I need.</p>
<p><img src="https://jf.si/images/2020/12/network_diagram.jpg" alt="Initial Network Diagram"></p>
<p>Then my friend M. and I started to install all the cables in the house I live in. We needed to install 5 cables from a basement and up to the first floor. Fun fact: CAT6 cables are thicker than CAT5e cables I was using earlier.</p>
<p>The other thing you can notice is that I didn&rsquo;t install cables inside the walls but rather in the plastic canals that I had to screw into the walls. In Europe, we seldomly have drywalls and don&rsquo;t have them in 70-year-old houses. So this was the only option.</p>
<p>A friend and I tried to install cable canals properly and in corners to cut them at 45 degrees angles. It took us almost half a day to install all the cable canals from the basement to the first floor. I calculated that we installed approximately 55 m of canals.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-the-right-server-rack">Choosing the right server rack</h2>
<p>Racks in Europe are expensive and of course, meant for a business that usually doesn’t look at the prices. An 18U rack would cost me about 500€ so I decided to include my father who suggested to make it from wood. And so we did. I bought the rack strips and spray can.</p>
<p>We used a frame from my childhood bunk bed that I shared with my sister. Also, I can&rsquo;t believe we still had that in storage. We finished the rack in 2 hours with all the sawing and putting it together and I measured the distance between rack strips at exactly 48,26 cm (19&quot;). Well, that was a mistake I figured out later.</p>
<p><img src="https://jf.si/images/2020/12/IMG_0649.jpg" alt="Server rack"></p>
<h2 id="router-switch--servers">Router, switch &amp; servers</h2>
<p>A lot of thought went into choosing the right equipment for my needs. Did I overdo it? Of course. Am I happy with my choice? Pretty much. The research was extensive and long. I&rsquo;ve read a lot of Reddit and forum posts.</p>
<h3 id="router">Router</h3>
<p>I knew I wanted to install <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">pfsense</a> on my router because I read how powerful and stable router OS it is. And that&rsquo;s why I had to find proper hardware for it. It can generally run on any x86 processor but if you want to have a bit higher bandwidth, firewall, and VPN throughput you need to choose a bit better hardware.</p>
<p>My router consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motherboard: Intel DQ77MK LGA1155</li>
<li>Processor: Intel Core i5-3570T 2,3GHz Socket 1155 (TDP: 45W)</li>
<li>Heat sink: SilverStone SST-NT07-115X</li>
<li>8GB DDR3 1600 MHz SDRAM</li>
<li>SATA SSD 120 GB</li>
<li>Housing In-Win IW-RF100 - 1U Short Depth Server Chassis - 365mm depth - with power supply</li>
<li>Intel PCI-E X1 Gigabit Server Ethernet Interface 1000M Network Card</li>
<li>2x Noctua NF-A4x20</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://jf.si/images/2020/12/IMG_0452.jpg" alt="Router internals - Noctua fans were added a bit later"></p>
<p><img src="https://jf.si/images/2020/12/heimdall_router.png" alt="Heimdall - Router"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll write about pfsense software in the next post.</p>
<h3 id="switch">Switch</h3>
<p>Because I previously owned Ubiquity Unifi APs (AC-Lite) and a PoE switch (8 PoE-60W) I decided to also buy a 24-PoE 250W Unifi switch. PoE is always great and I also got a good deal locally because Unifi equipment is as expensive as Apple&rsquo;s and its holds it price unbelievable so.</p>
<p><img src="https://jf.si/images/2020/12/unifi_switch.png" alt="Unifi 24-PoE 250W Switch"></p>
<h3 id="servers">Servers</h3>
<h4 id="supermicro-cse-826-x9dri-ln4f">SuperMicro CSE-826 X9DRi-LN4F+</h4>
<p>I found out that SuperMicro offers a lot of bang for the buck so I decided to invest in a server made by them. My friend E. suggested <a href="https://www.bargainhardware.co.uk/">Bargain Hardware</a> from the UK for a purchase of an used server and I must say that it was a really pleasant experience. Sure price is a bit higher than eBay but I also got 1 year warranty.</p>
<p>Specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chassis: 1 x SuperMicro CSE-826 X9DRi-LN4F+ Rev1.20 2U 12 LFF-HS</li>
<li>Processor(s): 2 x Intel Xeon E5-2630L V2 2.40Ghz Hexa (6) Core CPU*</li>
<li>Heatsink(s): 2 x Supermicro (SNK-P0047P) X9DRi-LN4F+ 1U LGA2011 Heatsink</li>
<li>Memory (RAM): 8 x 16GB - DDR3 1600MHz (PC3-12800R, 2Rx4) £180.00</li>
<li>Memory Blanks 16 x Dell DDR3 RAM Blank £8.00</li>
<li>RAID: HBA 9205-8i in IT mode*</li>
<li>Hard Drive Caddy(s) 12 x Supermicro CSE-826 LFF Hot-Swap Caddy</li>
<li>Hard Drives: 6 x 4TB 3.5&quot; HGST SAS 6Gbps*</li>
<li>Power Supply(s): 1 x SuperMicro (PWS-920P-SQ) CSE-826, CSE-847 Hot-Swap PSU 920W</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://jf.si/images/2020/12/yggdrasil_sm_cse826.png" alt="Yggdrasil - FreeNAS server"></p>
<p>This server serves (pun intended) as my NAS. It runs <a href="https://www.freenas.org/">FreeNAS</a> and I&rsquo;ll talk about it later. Is it overkill? Damn, right it is. Am I proud that I have it? Very much so.</p>
<p>*These components were replaced or added by me later.</p>
<h4 id="dell-r320">Dell R320</h4>
<p>The second server is meant for a playground. On it I run <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a> and spin up and down VMs as much as I want. I found it on eBay from a company that went broke so it was a pretty sweet deal.</p>
<p>Specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Processor: 1x Intel Xeon E5-2430L v2 2.40Ghz Hexa (6) Core CPU*</li>
<li>Memory (RAM): 64 GB DDR3 1600 Mhz</li>
<li>Hard Drives: 1x 120GB SSD, 1x 240GB SSD*</li>
<li>Power Supplies: 2x Dell 350W</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://jf.si/images/2020/12/loki_dell_r320.png" alt="Loki - Dell R320"></p>
<p>*These components were replaced or added by me later.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I must say it was a wild road of research and extreme patience because everything that I ordered took so much longer to come because of 2020. My homelab project started in April and was starting operating at the end of July.</p>
<p>But remember homelab is never done. Since July I have made quite a few additions and modifications that I&rsquo;ll share in the next blog posts. For all your questions or comments you can message me <a href="https://twitter.com/th0r">@th0r</a> or write an email that you find <a href="http://localhost:1313/about/">here</a>.</p>
