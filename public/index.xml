      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been hearing for the last 15 years that IPv6 is the future. Is it though? Google tracks it and it seems we came a long way since pre-2010 and we&amp;rsquo;re currently sitting at 45%. Not bad, not great.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been running pfsense for the last 4 years and at the beginning of the year I decided it was time to finally set it up on the home network. I looked at my options and remembered that my ISP could allocate me an IPv6 range.</description>

      <description>I run pfSense on my router but the company behind it has started being very anti-community and almost stopped supporting their CE version. So I faced a dilemma. Migrate to OpnSense, VyOS, or something else? I heard many good things about OpenBSD so I thought to myself &amp;ldquo;Why not&amp;rdquo;? I especially like OpenBSD&amp;rsquo;s commitment to high security standards and that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what&amp;rsquo;s needed for a router and a firewall that protects your home network.</description>

      <title>Beginning of a homelab</title>

      <description>It all started when my friend E. introduced me to the subreddit Homelab. Coincidentally this was on the 1st of April when we&amp;rsquo;re quite hopeful that the whole 2020 situation will go away soon. I started reading all the subreddit&amp;rsquo;s posts and was hooked.&#xA;The main reason to build a homelab was to replace my weak Synology 216play and to extend my storage, my computing power, and learn more about hypervisors, container systems, etc.</description>

      <description>During the four years I worked as a repair technician for iPhones and MacBooks, I heard lots of apologies and stories from people who brought their completely destroyed iPhones for repair on how they accidentally damaged the device.&#xA;Initially, I thought they were apologizing to me but I later realized that they were not apologizing to me but to themselves. About 90% of clients I asked about backing up their iPhone indicated that they never backed up their device in recent months.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been five years since I wrote something with more than 140 characters. Looking back on things I actually missed it. There was a time where everything was too much and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to write anything. That time has passed.&#xA;What will I write here? Mostly my thoughts and probably more tutorials for different devices that I own. In the upcoming weeks expect:&#xA;Importance of backups Xpenology guide: How to setup it on DSM 6.</description>
